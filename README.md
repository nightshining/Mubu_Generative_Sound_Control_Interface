# Mubu_Generative_Sound_Control_Interface
Mubu Generative Sound Control Interface is a processing graphical interface to control a MaxMSP audio patch. It connects via OSC from Processing to Max MSP MuBu a toolbox for Multimodal Analysis of Sound and Motion, Interactive Sound Synthesis and Machine Learning. 

MuBu handles: 

* Interactive Machine Learning
  * KNN (k-nearest neighbours search)
  * PCA (principal component analysis)
  * GMM (Gaussian mixture model recognition), GMR (regression)
  * HMM (hidden Markov model recognition), XMM (regression);
  * DTW (dynamic time warping)
  * Gesture following (GF) and Gesture Variation Following
* Interactive Sound Synthesis
  * Granular synthesis
  * Concatenative synthesis
  * Additive synthese
